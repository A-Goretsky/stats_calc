# Statistical calculator personal project. 

This project is used as a little dive into exploring the in's and out's of C++. Its data structure nuances, STL structures, existing algorithms, iterators, etc. Using some work from several years ago, such as my own Java implementations of various sorts and data structures, such as Min/Max Heaps and QuickSort, I'll be making various versions of basic statisctical calculations to see what variety of ways C++ will allow me to do them, from as little code as possible, to as low a complexity as possible.

## What is done now

* Several basic statistical calculations. (Mean, Mode, Standard Dev, Frequency List)
* A few translated sorts from Java.

## What will be implemented

* DOCTEST function testing
* Chi square evaluations
* Linear regression
* Hypothesis testing
* (Z-scores, T-scores, Degrees of Freedom)
* A fully functioning terminal interface. (Currently none exists).
* My own implementation of various data structures and sorts compared to those of the standard library.

## For later development

* Import CSV's
* Capable parsing of invalid and awkward input.
* Web App via React or GUI via QT.
